        Officially, Lagos became a Chapter when the Port Harcourt Chapter was created in August 1993.  However, the Club’s President at that time was domiciled in Lagos, therefore he occupied the position of National President/Chairman of Lagos Chapter.
The Lagos Chapter had always taken the lead in several initiatives both for the good of members and Asaba.

        <p className='Bp pt-12'>
        a)	Chapter Sinking Fund – Towards the end of the 90s, interest rates on borrowing had hit the roof.  Many of the Chapter members who had left employment and had started small businesses of their own were in serious trouble.  The leadership of Lagos Chapter in 1999 decided to set up a Sinking Fund to help them.

        b)	Public Lectures.
•	The first Lagos Chapter Public lecture was organized by the Chapter Exco at the Nigerian Institute for International Affairs, Kofo Abayomi Street, Victoria Island on Saturday, October 8, 2005 under the distinguished Chairmanship of Chief Philip Asiodu CON, Izoma Ahaba.

        The Port Harcourt Chapter became the first outside Lagos when it was inaugurated by Chief Anthony Ashiofu as President in 1993.  
The Port Harcourt Chapter showed great dynamism as soon as it was launched in August 1993.  The Chapter was characterised by youthful members who also were upwardly mobile.  Buoyed by one of the Club’s Patron, the late Chief Fred Eseanobi, Ihonor Ahaba who was resident in Port Harcourt, the Chapter contributed hugely to National activities in kind and in cash.

        <p className='Bp pt-12'>
        a)	Government Relationship
Activities of the Port Harcourt Chapter peaked in 2007 when ASDEV 81 Club made the protocol list of the River State Governor, His Excellency Dr. Peter Odili.  This was tantamount to being given the key to the gate of the Government house.  The Chapter took advantage of this and invited HRM, Obi Prof. Chike Edozien CFR, the Asagba of Asaba to visit with the Governor of Rivers State.  The evening the HRM arrived Port Harcourt, there was a grand reception for him and Agu Nwanyi with the River State Governor, the River State First Lady, all the State Commissioners, Ihonor Ahaba Chief Fred Eseanobi and his wife and all ASDEV members and their wives were present.

It was held on Friday, March 14, 2008 at the Riz Plaza, Port Harcourt. The symposium had the under listed as Resource Persons:

              Lagos was becoming too congested and the Military Government, decided to carve out a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in 1976 from parts of the states of old Kwara, Niger, Kaduna and Plateau States.  The objective was to eventually move the Administrative Capital of Nigeria to a more central location.  Movement of Federal Ministries and Parastatals to the FCT started in the 1980s but was accelerated following the Major Gideon Orkar Coup in 1990.  By December 21, 1991, Abuja was official proclaimed the Country’s Political Capital and the seat of power moved from Dodan Barracks in Lagos to Aso Rock, Abuja.

              Some ASDEV ’81 Club most of them Civil Servants relocated to Abuja and formed the nucleus of the Club.  By 1995, these members had attracted sufficient quality members to create a new Chapter.  Abuja was thus inaugurated by Ogbueshi Kanene Azinge as President in May, 1995.

              Asaba became the last of the local Chapters to be inaugurated by Ogbueshi Dr. Joseph Unokanjo in April, 1997.
Since Asaba Chapter was launched, members have shown serious commitment to the ASDEV vision and have taken the lead in initiating programs that have kept ASDEV 81 Club top of the mind in Asaba.

              b)	Rev. Fr. Vincent Mordi of blessed memory was an indigene of Asaba.  During his lifetime, he was for many years the Prior at St. Benedict’s monastery, Ewu, Edo State.  He encouraged many ASDEV members to spend time at the monastery and helped them grow spiritually.  Thus, at his retirement, the Chapter decided to send delegates to his send-forth in July 2010 and presented to him a cash gift of N50,000.00 (fifty thousand)

              c)	The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Asaba branch, in an attempt to construct a motor park, broke down the fence of Ogbeafor Primary School.  For many months the pupils of the school were exposed to great danger.  In the month of September 2010, the Asaba Chapter stepped in, rebuilt the fence and replaced the main gate.

              At the turn of the century, some foundation members of ASDEV had relocated to the US.  These members spread the ASDEV philosophy to Asaba people in the diaspora.  Late Augustine Ngezelonye a foundation member in Lagos, but now living in the US assisted by Uche Oduah was able to mobilize new members despite the size of the country and the Chapter was inaugurated on May 9, 2009 with Austen Ngezelonye as first Chairman.

              The story of the UK Chapter was different.  The ASDEV constitution demands that to become a full member of the Club, you must have attended one National meeting in Asaba.  The spirit of this clause is to encourage Asaba people wherever they are resident to come home once in a while.  This was a great impediment for the off take of the UK chapter.  However, a few interested UK residents were able to fulfil this clause and the Chapter was eventually chartered on November 28, 2009 with Reuben Parkinson as its first Chairman

              Unlike the USA Chapter that cannot meet physically because members are located in different States of the country, most of the UK Chapter members are located in and around London.  Therefore, they are able to meet physically every other month. 
Like the USA Chapter, members of the UK Chapter have also supported the National body by replicating some of the ASDEV activities abroad and helping in funding projects at home.  Some examples are:
